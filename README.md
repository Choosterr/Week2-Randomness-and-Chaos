# Week2-Randomness-and-Chaos

This week we are looking at a couple of ways we can harness randomenss and chaos for artistic purposes

`colors_arranged_by_chance.ipynb` explores several probability distributions by assigning colors in a grid. It also includes a simple example of gradient noise (simplex in this case).

`julia_fractals.ipynb` walks through how to implement julia fractals (a class of fractals that includes the mandelbrot set) with pytorch and shows how to create a video from a series of images. This will tie into your weekly assignment.
